Thanks for installing noirlings!

Is this your first time? Don't worry, noirlings is made for beginners! We are
going to teach you a bunch of stuff about the noir DSL language and prover backends!

Here's how noirlings works,

1. To start noirlings run `cargo run -r --bin noirlings watch`
2. It'll automatically start with the first exercise. Don't get confused by
error message popping up as soon as you run noirlings! This is part of the
exercise that you're supposed to solve, so open the exercise file in an editor
and start your detective work!
3. If you're stuck on an exercise, there is a helpful hint you can view by
typing `hint` (in watch mode), or running `cargo run -r --bin noirlings hint
exercise_name`.
4. When you have solved the exercise successfully, Remove `// I AM NOT DONE`
comment to move on to the next exercise.
5. If an exercise doesn't make sense to you, please open an issue on GitHub!.

Got all that? Great! To get started, run `noirlings watch` in order to get the
first exercise. Make sure to have your editor open!

### Adding new exercises

#### Here's what an exercise looks like,

1. An exercise is pretty much a single well commented Noir file.
2. Exercises are organised into modules and are placed in `./exercises/<module_name>/<exercise_name>.nr`
3. Exercise accompanies some metadata describing it in `./info.toml`
4. When introducing a concept for the first time, try to start minimally.
5. Subsequent exercises for the same concept can grow in complexity.

#### Contributing with a new exercise

1. Add the exercise file in the `./exercises` directory.
2. Insert information about the exercise in `./info.toml` file. For example
   ```toml
   [[exercises]]
   name = "new_exercise"
   path = "exercises/new_module/new_exercise.nr"
   mode = "test"
   hint = """
   Try the Harlem shake
   """
   ```
3. Run your exercise with `noirlings run` as you write

```
cargo run -r --bin noirlings run new_exercise
```

4. Check that the [tests](#testing) pass.
5. Send your PR!
